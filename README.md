# Strings and Loops


## Count Occurences
Write the function called *count_occurrences()* that takes two strings. The function should return how many times the second string occurs in the first string.

Example 1:

```python
count_occurrences("banana","a")
```
Output
```
3
```

Example 2:
```python
count_occurrences("'It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place.' â€” The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger", "rained")
```
Output
```
3
```

## Reverse
Write the function called *reverse()* that takes one string. The function should return a string in which the letters of the string are reversed.

Example 1:
```python
reverse("reversed")
```
Output:
```python
"desrever"
```

Example 2:
```python
reverse("Austin High")
```
Output:
```python
"hgiH nitsuA"
```

## Replace Cat With Dog
Write a function called replace_cat() that takes one string. The function should replace any occurence of the string "cat" with "dog". The modified string should be returned.

Example 1:
```python
replace_cat("concatenate")
```
Output:
```python
"condogenate"
```
Example 2:
```python
replace_cat("Cats are the best!")
```
Output:
```python
"Dogs are the best!"
```
